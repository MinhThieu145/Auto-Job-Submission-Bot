THE POSSIBLE ZONE

BOSTON, MA

The Possible Zone (TPZ), a nonprofit youth development and entrepreneurship program based in Boston, seeks a Controller to join our growing Finance team and organization. The ideal candidate has deep nonprofit accounting and grant management experience, as well as experience implementing financial systems and processes in growing organizations. The ideal candidate is also passionate about closing the opportunity gap for young people, enabling them to shape their own futures. This is a hybrid role based in our Boston Innovation Center, with the expectation of working at least two to three days per week in the office.

ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ZONE:

What if all young people could follow their dreams? What if they had the opportunity to design and launch a company or social-venture they were passionate about? What if they knew what an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, industrial designer, data scientist, marketing executive, electrical engineer, biotech researcher, advanced manufacturer, roboticist, game designer, journalist, nonprofit leader or mayor does and why? What if they were given the opportunity to intern in these positions and work settings while still in high school? And what if they had the chance to learn the foundational professional and technical skills needed to succeed in any of these careers? And very importantly, what if they develop a mindset, where their imagination and creativity can be fully explored, where everything is possible and where no boundaries exist? Would young people believe they could pursue these careers or any others they choose? Would they become what they had dreamed?

At The Possible Zone, our resounding answer is YES! We are on a journey to develop a transformative model and facility in the heart of Boston’s most diverse and youth-populated communities.

TPZ is an eleven-year-old non-profit organization that has served well over 1,000 students with programming, internships and advisory services during high school toward the mission of economic equity. Our program has demonstrated strong impact in terms of high school graduation, matriculation into post-secondary education and careers, and strong Social Emotional Learning and Identity Development. As we further expand into Boston, TPZ Programming will catalyze a Boston Community Ecosystem that will include students, parents, high schools, community organizations, large corporations, local entrepreneurs, technology companies, venture capitalists, and postsecondary education institutions. Our intent is to join and continue to enhance a Student Ecosystem in Jackson Square and surrounding communities that are similar to those that have emerged in other Greater Boston areas such as Kendall Square and the Seaport District. Collectively we will dream, learn, work, and ultimately create leadership opportunities for economic mobility and prosperity for our students and their surrounding community. Importantly, TPZ is highly committed to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in everything we do. And as we establish success in our Boston Headquarters, we will scale our efforts to replicate TPZ’s blueprint at a National level.

We envision a program and space that serves tens-of-thousands of students over the next decade(s). When a student enters the program, they will be

… greeted, coached, taught, counseled and supported by highly trained, caring staff and partners in entrepreneurship and business, leadership and team building, passion and perseverance, learning and accountability and empathy and integrity.

… challenged to pursue their passions and launch ventures in everything from electronics, software, digital media, services, fashion, food, to consumer goods

… equipped with the life skills essential to thrive in the emerging economy

… building social networks through connection to professional mentoring and internships with hundreds of local companies

… supported when needed through wrap-around services in academic tutoring, ESL, mental health, food security, and college success by partner organizations

Ultimately, through their experiences and growth at TPZ, and with our partners, our students will be prepared and inspired to attend college, alternative post-secondary education and launch careers in their community, where they will pursue their passions in business, STEAM, Community and Entrepreneurial organizations.

Our students - all students - deserve to pursue their passions and achieve economic equity.
